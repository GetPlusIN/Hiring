#### Assignment: Restaurant Finder App

**Objective:**
Create a mobile application using Flutter that interacts with a database to fetch and display information about restaurants in a city.

**Requirements:**
* Dart and Flutter
* An IDE (VS Code or Android Studio)
* Create fake data in the DB

**Description:**
The application should have the following features:

1. **City Selection:** The application should allow users to input a city name.

2. **Display Restaurants:** After a city is selected, the application should display a list of restaurants in that city. The list should display the name, average cost for two people, and the average rating of each restaurant.

3. **Restaurant Detail:** When a user taps on a restaurant from the list, the app should display more details about that restaurant - such as address, hours, and phone number.

**Steps:**

**1. Project Setup:**
   Setup the Flutter project with the necessary dependencies.

**2. Create Data Models:**
   Define the data model for the restaurant.

**3. API Services:**
   Setup a service to interact with the API: fetching data from the API, decoding the JSON response, and error handling.

**4. UI:**
   Build the app interface. This includes the screens to display the list of restaurants and the detailed view of a selected restaurant.

**5. Fetching and Displaying the Data:**
   Fetch the data from the DB using the service you created and display it in the UI.

**6. Testing:**
   Write unit tests for the data models, DB service, and UI.

**7. Documentation:**
   Add comments to the code where necessary and include a README file that explains how to run the project and any other relevant information.

**Deliverables:**
1. The source code of the Flutter application.
2. A README file with instructions on how to build and run the project.
3. All tests should pass.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Code Quality: The code should be clear, readable, and well-organized.
2. UI/UX: The app should be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean, uncluttered interface.
3. Error Handling: The app should properly handle potential issues, like a failed request or receiving unexpected data.
4. Testing: The application should include a robust suite of tests.
5. Documentation: The README should accurately explain how to run the project, and the code should include comments where necessary.
